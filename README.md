# GQL C++ Parser Library

This library is a C++ parser and AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) implementation for the GQL database language (ISO/IEC 39075:2024). 
It requires C++17 or later and is distributed under the Apache License 2.0.

The library is designed to map GQL syntax to C++ types, enabling full static type checking and type safety. The AST does not use virtual functions.

Below are examples demonstrating how GQL expressions are represented in C++ types.

### GQL Specification:
```
<graph pattern> ::=
  [ <match mode> ] <path pattern list>
    [ <keep clause> ]
    [ <graph pattern where clause> ]

<path pattern list> ::=
  <path pattern> [ { <comma> <path pattern> }... ]    
```

### gql C++ Library:
```cpp
using PathPatternList = std::vector<PathPattern>;

struct GraphPattern {
  std::optional<MatchMode> matchMode;
  PathPatternList patterns;
  std::optional<KeepClause> keep;
  std::optional<GraphPatternWhereClause> where;
};
```

### GQL Specification:
```
<primitive data-modifying statement> ::=
    <insert statement>
  | <set statement>
  | <remove statement>
  | <delete statement>
```

### gql C++ Library:
```cpp
using PrimitiveDataModifyingStatement =
    std::variant<InsertStatement, SetStatement, RemoveStatement, DeleteStatement>;
```

## Usage

To parse a GQL query from a string:
```cpp
#include <gql/parser/parser.h>

void load_query(const char* query) {
  try {
    gql::ast::GQLProgram program = gql::parser::ParseProgram(query);
  } catch (const gql::parser::ParserError& e) {
    std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
  }
}
```

The AST provided by the library follows these principles:
- Simple `struct`s
- `std::optional` for optional child nodes
- `std::variant` for alternative child nodes
- `std::vector` for sequences of child nodes

The root node of the AST is `gql::ast::GQLProgram`. All AST nodes are defined in `include/gql/ast/nodes/`.

Thanks to static typing, traversing the AST should work seamlessly with full IDE support. Handling `variant`s can be somewhat cumbersome, so here’s a recommended approach:
```cpp
void process(const gql::ast::LinearDataModifyingStatementBody& body) {
  for (const auto& stmt : body.statements) {
    gql::ast::variant_switch(
        stmt,
        [&](const gql::ast::SimpleQueryStatement& value) {
          // Execute simple data-accessing statement
          ...
        },
        [&](const gql::ast::PrimitiveDataModifyingStatement& value) {
          // Execute primitive data-modifying statement
          ...
        },
        [&](const gql::ast::CallProcedureStatement& value) {
          // Execute call procedure statement
          ...
        });
  }
}
```

In certain cases, the library employs the `value_ptr` smart pointer class (with type aliases ending in `Ptr`) to manage recursive types. The parser ensures these pointers are always initialized, allowing safe access without additional checks.

## Build

The library uses CMake as its build system. Client code should link against the `gql_parser` static library, defined in `src/parser/CMakeLists.txt`.

To build the library:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

If your project does not use CMake, you can manually include the library sources in your build system with minimal effort.

## Extensibility

The AST data structures are intentionally simple, but you may need to store additional information in the AST beyond the parsing stage.

To facilitate this, you can provide a custom base class for AST nodes. If you define `GQL_AST_CUSTOM_NODE_BASE_INCLUDE` as a preprocessor macro with a header filename, 
the specified file will be included before the AST node class definitions. This file can define a custom `gql::ast::NodeBase<T>` template, allowing you to override 
the default base class for specific or all AST node types.

Refer to `include/gql/ast/nodes/base.h` for further details.
